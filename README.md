Flaty is a mobile-ready application that aims to ease certain aspects in resident's associations across Romania.

## The Team
    
  During this project, the team is made from the following mates: 
  - [Toma](mailto:rptoma@gmail.com)- Spech master, dev and tester
  - [Alexandru](mailto:alexandrumargan@gmail.com) - Dev, tester and UI Design

  - [Andra](mailto:diana.alexandra.puiu@gmail.com)- Dev, tester and UI Design

Our team will develop an Android and iOS application that aims to make the notice board from every staircase forgotten.  You can find the app ready to be downloaded [TO DO:: ADD AppStore and GooglePlay links here]. 


### Problems

As a team, we noticed for Flaty several problems:

1. We don't know how old people will react to it
2. We have to learn React Native in order to make it for both Android and iOS platforms

Our major problem is that we don't have any clue how the old people from old neighborhoods will react to this new application and neither if that they have access to a smartphone with Android or iOS.


### Our Solution

Our solution to that major problem is to educate properly the eledry ones and give them all the support to learn how to handle our application in order to make their life much easier.

### Customer Segment

Flaty is aiming to customers from all the resident areas, including the administrators of the associations.


### Competition
